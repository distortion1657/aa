Hello, I am Ananda Kumar Shrestha, a self-taught artist who finds peace in painting. I specialize in Acrylic colors but my skills do not lack 
on the other aspects of art. I've worked with countless clients to tailor them a piece of their liking and delivering something they would be 
proud to hang on their walls. If you have an empty wall, why not decorate it with an elegant artwork that will certainly be a conversation starter.
Your satisfaction is my gratification.
